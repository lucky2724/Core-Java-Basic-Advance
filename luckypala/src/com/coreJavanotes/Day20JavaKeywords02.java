		JAVA KEY-WORDS:
			Premitive data types:
				Numbers:
					==>To represent only numbers will use below data  types.
						1)byte
						2)short
						3)int
						4)long
						
				Floating:	
					==>To represents floating point data will use given data types
						5)float
						6)double
						
				Character:	
					==>To represents single character
						7)char
				
				True or false:
					==>for representing either true or false
						8)boolean
						
			Application Level:
				Top level:
					9)pacakage:
						-A package is folder structure to keep collection of classes and interfaces.
						(java.lang) default package.
					10)import:
						-for accessing one package class into another package will use input.
						Ex:import java.util.*;
					
				Type level:
					11)class:
						-Class is a keyword to create classes.
						-class is blueprint of object.
						-By using one class to create many objects.
					12)interface:
						-interface is a keyword to create interfaces to achive abstraction in java.
						-abstraction means implementation details.
						-interface is a blueprint of class.
				    13)enum:
				    	-enum is a keyword to maintain constant values at one place.
				    		Ex:days,months
				    14)new:
				    	-to create objects in java will use new keyword.
				    15)instance of:
				    	-to check references like whether the references is from specified object or not.
				    
				Method level:
					16)void:
						-It returns Nothing.
					17)return:
						-return type
					18)var:
						-Store genaric data.
						
				Oops:
					19)this:
						-invoking current object data.
					20)super:
						-invoking parent  class data.
					21)extends:
						-achiving inhertance in java.
					22)implements:
						-achieving interfaces in java.
					23)assert:
						-
			Access Modifiers and other modifiers:
				Access Modifiers:
					24)private:
						-private is not applicable for class its illegal.
						-private keyword we can use for
							-Data members
							-Constructors
							-Inner class
							-Innerr Interfaces
						  But not for classes and interfaces & Blocks.
						-THE SCOPE OF PRIVATE IS WITHIN THE CLASS ONLY
						
					25)<default>:
						-If you are not giving any modifiers then will considerthat <default> or undefined.
						-default keyword we can use for
							-Data members
							-Constructors
							-Inner class
							-Innerr Interfaces
							-class
							-interfaces 
								Except for blocks.
						-THE SCOPE OF <DEFAULT> IS WITHIN THE PACKAGE.
						
					26)protected:
						-protected keyword we can use for
							-Data members
							-Constructors
							-Inner class
							-Innerr Interfaces
						  But not for class,interface and Blocks.
						-THE SCIPE OF PROTECTED WITHIN THE PACKAGE AND OUTSIDE OF PACKAGE 
						 SUBCLASSES WITH SUBCLASS OBJECT REFERENCE ONLY.
						 
					27)public:
						-public keyword we can use for everywhere except for blocks.
						-THE  SCOPE OF PUBLIC IS WITHIN THE PROJECT,PACKAGE WE CAN ACCESS.
						
					private < <default> < protected < public.
					
				Other modifiers:
					28)abstract:
						-Hiding implementation details and showing only specifications.
						-we can use methods and classes only.
						
					29)static:
						-static keyword use for data memebers,blocks,inner class ,interfaces.
						-we can not use constructors,class,interfaces.
					
					30)strictfp:
						-strictly following floating point data.
						-All systems we use strictfp classes,methods but not variables.
					
					31)synchronized:
						-for achieving synchronized multithreaded programming will use synchronize for blocks and methods.
						-executing thread one after another.
						
					32)transient:
						-we can use only for variable.
						-transient will use serialization to protect system data.
						serialization-->object one place to another.
					
					33)volatile:
						-we can use only for variables.
						-volatile means keep on changing the value even though threads are sleep mode.
						
					34)native:
						-only for methods.
						-we want to communicate other language use native.with third party language.
					
					35)final:
						-we can use class,methods and variables.
						-if a class is final we can't extends class.
						-if a method is final we can't override that.
						-if a variable is final we can't change.
						
				Exception Handling:
					36)try:
						-Block of code where exceptions might occur.
					37)catch:
						-Block that handles the exception.
					38)finally:
						-Block that always executes(used for cleanup)
					39)throw:
						-explicitly throw a execption
					40)thows:
						-used in method signature to declare checked exceptions.
					41)try with reources:
						-
				Logical statements:
					42)if
					43)else
