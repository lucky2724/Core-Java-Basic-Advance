		 OOPS :
		 	Method Overloading :
		 		
		 	POLYMPORPHISM :
		 		-Many form
				
				Why Polymorphism:
					To provide flexibility to our code.we need polymorphism
				What is Polymorphism :
					==>Whenever we have same specifications or functinalities instead of creating 
						defferent names creating only one name with multiple methods based on requirement 
						is the concept of MOL
						
					2 ways of Polymorphism :
						1)Static Polymorphism ==> (Method overloading) ==> complile time polymorphism
						2)Dynamic Polymorphism ==>  (Method overrideing) ==> run time polymorphism
						
				Method Overloading :
					-In java we have multiple methods with same name and defferent as parameters will consider as MOL.
					
					Best Example is : println();
					
							System.out.println(mol);
							System.out.println();
							System.out.println("Haii");
							System.out.println(10);
							System.out.println(234567890L);
							System.out.println(2345.876);
							System.out.println(3456.76F);
							System.out.println('M');
							System.out.println(false);
