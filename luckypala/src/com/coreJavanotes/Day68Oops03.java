	OOPS 03 :
		Inheritance 01 :
			==>Inheritance is the process of getting properties or Data members from parent to child class.
			==>Inheritance is working based on relationships
				-IS-A Relationship
				-HAS-A Relationship
			==>To achive Inheritance will use extends keyword
			
			IS-A :
				class Vehicle  (Parent or base or super class)
				
				(child or derived or sub classes)
				class Car
				class Bike
				class Auto 
				
				Ex:
					Car is a vehicle
					
					class Car extends Vehicle
					class Bike extends Vehicle
					
			HAS-A :
				class car {
					Engine e = new Engine();
				}
				
				class Engine;
				
			Types Of Inheritance : 
				1)Single Inheritance
				2)Multi level Inheritance
				3)Multiple Inheritance is not possible with classes
				4)Heirarchical Inheritance
				5)Hybrid Inheritance
				6)Cyclic Inheritance is not possible with any type 
				
			Note : In Every Java program we have Inheritance without using extends key word.
					-Every Java class extends Object class by default whether we menthioned or not.
					
					
					
		Object Class methods :
			-every class is direct access in object methods.
			-In java object class we have total 11 methods
			
				1)Object clone();
					-creates and returns Shallow copy of object
				2)boolean equals(Object obj);
					-used to compare two objects for logical equality
				3)void finalize();
					-called by garbage colector before object destruction
				4)class getClass();
					-returns fully qualified name of the class
				5)int hashcode();
					-address of object cotains hexa decimal
				6)String to String();
					-returns String representation of object
				
				7)void wait();
				8)void wait(long ms);
				9)void wait(long ms,long ns);
				
				10)void notify();
				11)void notifyAll();
