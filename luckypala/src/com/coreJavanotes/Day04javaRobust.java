		 JAVA IS ROBUST:
		 	Robust means--->Strong
		 	
		 	-->In java with Strong memory management.
		 		like-->
		 			-Method Area
		 			-Heap Area
		 			-Static Area
		 			-Pc registers
		 			-Native method stack Area
		 			
		 	-->Including GC(Garbage Collections)
		 	
		 	-->In java with Exception Handling (why because java is Strong)
		 			-try,catch,finally,throw,throws
		 			
		 	-->With the concept of multithreading.
		 		performance is High.
		 	-->Thread is a term came from multitasking.
		 	-->Reduceing response time.
		 	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	 	
		 	
		 	print-ln-->new line
		 	print-inline
		 	
		 	Collection of characters ==> " " ==>for String
		 							-String name="Lucky pala";
		 	Single characters ==> ' ' ===>for Character
		 							-char Gender='M'
		 	for numbers ==>  ==>
		 							-int a=6;
		 							-double b=3.4;
		 	Compilation-
		 				-Java compiler
		 				-does not contain main method program will compile but not execution...
		 				
		 	Execution-
		 			Byte code to Native code
		 				-JVM
		 		JVM calls main method
		 		
		 			public-
		 				-for JVM visibility must public is use.
		 				-public is used for visibility to JVM.
		 			
		 			Static-
		 				-JVM calls static method...
		 				
		 			Void-
		 				-void is used for No return...
		 				-Every method must be return anythong..
		 			
		 			method-->Block of code.
		 					-maintain logics.
		 					
		 				In java main method not return anything...
		 			
		 			
		 			(String [] args) ===>
		 				args===>replce anything  ex==>(String [] lucky)
		 				
		 			must use in main method
		 				public ==>for visibility
		 				static ==>without object
		 				void  ==>main method return not anything.
		 				
		 			public static void main (String [] args) ====> understand for jvm 
		 						syntax of method:
		 									<Access modifie> <modifier> return_type  method name(){
		 											//code
		 									}
		 									
		 				does not contain static ====> Instance method.
		 				
		 				main method call without object use ==>Static.
