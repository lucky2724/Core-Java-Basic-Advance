		OOPS 01:
			Why oops...?
				-The way of Programming in a structured manner.
				-To achive
					-Security
					-Modularity
					-Reusability
					-Flexibility
					-Loose Couplings
					
			What is Oops..?
				-Object oriented Programming System or Structue.
				-If we want to achive above concepts we must need follow  4 Ethics or principles in java
					1)Encapsulation
					2)Abstraction
					3)Inheritance
					4)Polymorphism
					
			why we need object..?
				-To work with RealWorld applications we need realtime entity.
				-A realtime entity is an Object.
				-Without an object we can not create applications.
				
						Ex:Banking Application
							Bank 
							Employees:lucky,rajesh
							customers:raj,ram
						
			What is Object..?
				-Object is instance of class.
				-Object is a realtime entity. 
				
			why we need Class..?
				-To create  n number of objects based on requirement we need class.
				-Without a class we can not create a object.
				Ex:
					class Bank;
					class Book;
					
				
			What is class..?
				-Class is a Blue print of an object.
				-A class is a plan  or design or architecture or overview or step by step process to build objects.
				
			Encapsulation : -Binding or Bundling or Wrapping the data with related functionalities into a Single Unit 
							called Encapsulation.
							-Single unit can be a class or package.	
							-In Java,Creating a class itself is following Encapsulation mechanism.
							-In SQL,Creating a table itself is following Encapsulation mechanism.
							
						In Java ,Encapsulation is providing two sub concepts
							1)Data Hiding - Hiding the data with Encapsulation.
							2)Abstraction - Hiding the Implementation With interface and abstract keyword.
							
						Data Hiding	: 
							-Stop the direct access from one class to another class.
							-Provide the restricted access with Setters and getters is the conecept of Data Hiding.
							-With Data Hiding we can achive Data Security.
							
						// DTO -> Data transfer object
						/// 	-tarnsfering the data one location to anthor location where we need to use DTO.
						// POJO -> plain old java object
						/// 
								-A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java class that does not depend on any special framework, library, or inheritance.
								It usually contains:
								
								Private variables
								
								Public getters and setters
								
								Constructors
								
								toString() method (optional)
								
								POJOs are mainly used to store data (like a model).
						// MODEL ->Data model
