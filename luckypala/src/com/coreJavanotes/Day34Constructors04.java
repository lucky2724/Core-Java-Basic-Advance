		 CONSTRUCTORS 04:
		 	Inheritance:
		 		-Getting the parent class properties or functionalities to child class 
		 		 will go for Inheritance.
		 		-Inheritance can help for code reusability..
		 		-IS-A-RELATIONSHIP
		 		
		 		this.name --> for curent class
		 		super.name --> for parent class
		 		
		 		==> this & super we can use only in instance area can not use static area.
		 		
		 		==>this() & super () can only use for constructors not for methods.
		 		
		 		-->Every constructor in java will call super() without fail.
		 		-->If we are not calling any other constructor.
		 		
		 		==>In parent class we have only parametrized constructor will error in child class.
		 		     -if exists must be no-arg constructor in parent class.
		 		     
		 		     
		 	COPY CONSTRUCTOR:
		 		Why we need copy constructors;
		 			-Avoiding duplictate date while creating objects.
		 			
		 		What is copy consstructor:
		 			-Copying one object into another object is the concept is Copy constructor...
